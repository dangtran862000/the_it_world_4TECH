I have been living and studying in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City for 20 years. Currently, I am a second-year student with my first semester in major that is a bachelor of information technology at RMIT Vietnam University. For me, the field of science and technology, especially information technology, has brought me the passion to learn new knowledge by the vastness of the IT world. I first encountered programming in grade 8, when it was the pascal programming language as an official subject in the school curriculum. I was intrigued by the command lines and the magic of computer algorithms. Since then, I have decided to enter the computer science class at high school and have achieved the silver medal for good students in IT. Besides, not only interested in technology but also music for example playing instruments and participating in volunteer activities are my hobbies. I hope that the time I spend studying and researching information technology will help me improve my professional knowledge and hands-on experience in the technology industry.</p>

Instead of choosing to become a doctor or pharmacist, I followed my passion and became a member of SST (School of Science and Technology). I have a great curiosity to explore the Data Industry, and I expect to be a Data Scientist. Our team name is called '4tech', which stands for 'Four for Technology.'

I am Vietnamese, born in Ho Chi Minh city and I’ve spent three years studying abroad in Sydney, Australia and graduated high school there. My hobbies are playing an instrument (piano and guitar), listening to music, and playing games. I like playing games and I’m curious about how they operate behind the scenes. I also like to sit on my computer doing research, so I think doing IT is suitable for me. I’ve had the basic knowledge about coding in Python 3.0+ as it was a part of the study program that I took part in.</p>

Currently, in 2020, I am studying Information Technology program at RMIT with specialising in web development because I want to be a full-stack developer and mobile developer. In the past, I used to have a strong passion for football and swimming because I can connect closer to my friends and I can train myself. I have won a championship in a competition in high school. I have to admit that it is the best experience and exciting during my high school lifetime. However, my passion for IT became large when I saw my big brother, a competitive programmer, solving many challenging database problems such as arrays, multidimensional arrays and matrices in an online contest every weekend. Then, I follow his path to solving problems on the Leetcode website and join a contest at the weekends.</p>

Besides, with good observation and ability to communicate I will be one of the connections that help the team can work together comfortably. Also, as a result of my personality test and Myers-Briggs, I always have a positive and responsible energy in my assigned work.

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>In general, IT staff play an important role in monitoring and maintaining the operation of computers and networks of an organization or enterprise. In the era of technology 4.0, the emergence of new technologies in everyday work requires someone to install, diagnose software and hardware failures, and resolve these technical problems.</p>
        <p>The work is as well as general knowledge about how computer systems are used and applying technical understanding relevant to computer software or hardware. For other IT students, their ideal job is usually an application developer, a website developer or one of the other specific IT fields. But for me this is considered an ideal job because it gives me an overview of a big picture of the world of technology instead of just focusing on a specific field.</p>
        <p>After consulting the Burning Glass data, I decided I would not change this ideal job because of the opportunities that this job offers me. This work provides a dynamic, comfortable and professional working environment with no sitting at the desk all day. It opens up many possibilities for developing my skills, building relationships, updating new technologies, not just software and hardware, and training my English skills.</p>
        <p>In short, this job will not bring a significant income and is not the dream job of many people. However,  IT officers are an indispensable part of any business, who helps to bring about the smooth and balanced working of a computer system. Besides, this job creates a great career opportunity in the era of industrialization and modernization today.</p>

        <dt>After consulting the information provided by Burning Glass Data, I still have not changed the viewpoint of my ideal Job. The following are additional analyzes for the above statement:</dt><br>
        <dd>- The Specialised Skills listed Python with the low employers' demand and without the existence of the R programming language. However, according to the information provided by the Online data science community Kaggle's annual survey, “ Python is utilized by 76.3% of respondents and R by 59.2%” . [1]. So Python and R still play a crucial role in the Data area.</dd><br>
        <dd>- Presentation skills, as well as Analytical skills, support Data scientists to demonstrate their results with other teams and customers who cannot 'read' the statistic.</dd><br>
        <dt>Although the Data Science Job was not listed as a high demand job in the Burning Burning Glass Data 2018, I  still love to do this job because of my passion for data, and I believe in the future with rapid development, the demand for employers to data also increases.</dt>

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>After looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed. In my views, a Software Engineer is the one who has the ability to create new advanced, innovative products to help the community in various fields of life. This job required to have a high determination and a mindset of not giving up which I have as being a Software Engineer is considered to be one of the most stressful jobs. For me, being a Software Engineer is one dream I want to have come true in the future.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, at this time of life where it is called the 4.0 ages, the age of technology, this is the time when the people want the most advanced and innovative technologies for their life. That becomes a big chance for developers to have their creativity to actually act and create products that can supply the needs for users and this is the time where different companies are trying to recruit the qualified employees to be a part of their families. Nowadays, thanks to the innovating of programming languages, they have come up with an easy high-level programming language called Python, which can be approachable by everyone at the biggest operating system (Microsoft Windows and MacOS). According to different surveys on coders of all ages, Python is easy to learn, and it can be really efficient as there are many different sources and libraries for users to work on their project. Even though in the Burning Glass data, Python is not one of the top biggest languages, these results were in March 2018 and now is August 2020, which means more than 2 years already and it is way different now.</p>
        <p>Besides that, Software Engineers are the ones who bring needs in different areas of life into their products (medical, entertainment, etc.). Without these people, it is a big loss to a company when it comes to competing in this time era. </p>

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>Obviously no, there is an enormous demand for constructing and developing websites to meet human's desires. Currently, around 1.8 billion websites are created with approximately 400 million active. </p>
        <p>Although the job titles for web developers are around 381 in Australia in 2018, the number of websites are growing very fast. To be clear, it is not very reliable to use outdated-data to compare with the current jobs. There are so many web applications we use nowadays such as Facebook, Youtube, etc. Note that, for people who use computers, they preferably use a web-based platform, which is convenient to open multiple websites for doing their work and easier for searching for their likes. Therefore, seeing fewer jobs for a web developer in a country is not right as a whole.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, the decentralized web will be the next era of web development, in which user's data will be owned by themselves and not collected by the organisation or company. Thus, jobs for a web developer will be in high demand.</p>

    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">I teach computing although my background is quite complicated because I was not originally an IT professional. I came into computing as my first degree was in psychology. When I was studying for my degree, in the 1980s, microcomputers were starting to be used more commonly. A lot of psychology about doing mathematical tests of significance. For example, when you experiment with making a decision about whether the results are due to chance or actually unlikely to be significant. As a result, I did a lot of programming of those mathematical tests and that's how I actually started being interested in computing and also being realizing that the way you present information in the system is really importantr</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">As a lecturer, I started working in computing in 1992, that was when I did my PhD. Again, when i started working on my PhD, I worked in the university that used mackintoshes. I was very interested in graphic user interfaces and the way they present information, so my PhD was about different styles of user interface. Later, I went to work in the university in the UK because the curriculum included a topic area called human computer interaction, which is cognitive ergonomics. This was the area I was building courses about human computer interaction in the early 90s, which is still my core subject. After that, I became interested in another area called computer forensics, which is a very related area because it's about how people use computers when they are engaging in criminal activity.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">I did actually work in the period of time in the civil service department called the land registry. During the period that I was working there, most of the work I did was actually manual. We had large rooms full of filing cabinets, full of paper records but whilst I was there they were starting to change that information to computer-based records. Every piece of land you have to have a list of the legal constraints on that land, the proprietor of the land. You need to have a map of exactly the location of the land, so you can identify it. There are lots of different kinds of media present within each of those records for each piece of land and what priority of work you have to do.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">Work primarily in University, so mostly teachers/lecturers and students. Requires not just passing ideas but also need to have two way interactions. Besides that, interactions with different types of computers’ systems.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>5. Please tell us about your interaction with other IT professionals?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">As a lecturer I mostly work with other lecturers inside and outside my university. Usually we would talk about new projects/ideas that we find fascinating and we would discuss about the new topics and different ways to educate our students.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>6. What about your interaction with clients or investors? </i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">As I’m a lecturer so I would consider my students to be my clients that I mostly work with. I would judge my success based on their levels of achieving the knowledge that I shared with them and how they apply those to their life in the future. </p><br>
     <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>7.  What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">I spend a lot of time interacting with students to comprehend if they understand the lecture if they have any difficulties. Besides, I'm researching new technologies to modernize the lecture. Because lesson programs always have to be updated according to contemporary times, lectures must also be renewed to keep up.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>8. Which aspects of your work do you spend most of your time on and find most challenging?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">Teaching about the subject is challenging as new exciting and new things keep being introduced as time goes on, so it is challenging to adapt to those and transfer it the easiest way to students. In addition to the challenge of updating much new knowledge, I also have to try to develop my lecture adequately and more clearly to understand. Use simple words to describe broad and moderately confusing topics for beginners.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">Everything is the same except that the focus of the environment keeps shifting and keeps changing throughout the time. For example, I learn new applications produced to work to supply the original center of the situation. Besides, I also update the information by going to many different companies and working conditions to observe how they handle the times' innovation.</p>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">The cloud, services, and servers may look different, but they have a close relationship together. Those things work in tandem to create a cloud computing system, which is directly connected to the internet to store web data, store and share data [2]. Cloud computing brings convenience and security to customers by being independent from your local storage environments instead of physical storage devices. It allows users including individuals, organizations and businesses to transfer files and folders quickly and flexibly in separate ways. User data is encrypted and stored in servers owned by cloud service providers. However, customers need to pay a fee according to the contract signed between the service provider [3]. This brings a small financial benefit to businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, instead of investing large sums of money to invest, upgrade and maintain the local information server system. Nowadays, with the advent of new advanced technologies, cloud computing has developed and become one of the essential parts of the computer industry.</h6>

        <h3 ><i>What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Over the last ten years, the application of cloud computing at the consumer level to businesses has witnessed explosive developments and has become more widespread. Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle, are one of the software providers who have endeavored to promote and encourage consumers to use separate online storage system services instead of on-site storage, provided by payment methods based on the available subscription packages [4]. This is also considered to be equivalent to cloud computing services.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Today, mobile cloud computing is equipped with new infrastructures, which is exploited using the link and the combination of cloud platforms and mobile devices. Currently, cloud computing has been able to handle large tasks with large storage capacity. According to a 451 analysis study, more than one-third of the total workload of businesses is primarily running on the public cloud in 2019 [4]. Besides, IDC research shows that in 2018 more than one half of IT infrastructure spending is spent on cloud platforms and will reach 60-70% of this entire infrastructure, including services, software, and technology by 2020 [4]. That is a strong development as well as the need to use cloud computing is increasing.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In the next 3 to 10 years, the world will witness the remarkable development of clouds, services, servers. Based on a survey by Google Cloud, more than 47% of businesses have already used private and public cloud platforms for their IT facilities and this percentage has increased approximately 30% about the conjecture that the enterprises have believed cloud computing will fulfill over a quarter part the requirement  in 2029 [5]. With the large support of executives, the cloud will rise to the forefront in the next decade from now around the world. Cloud computing contributes to profitability in revenue and becomes a driving force for socio-economic development in the next few years.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The multi-cloud development model, which represents the platform's future mission, is being selected for future implementation by leveraging the interference between different cloud service providers in many kinds of ways. Service providers have been racing to come up with 5G network technology to satisfy this demand. 5G networks will address issues related to connection speeds and will be available soon [6]. That advent is said to be a stepping stone to improve the connection quality between the local system and the cloud in an age when all data is systematically moved on the internet. Besides, information security when using cloud computing today is one of the topics that are security experts in general and service providers in particular. Moreover, the artificial intelligence system is being carefully researched and measured to connect with the cloud to pass big data and suit the functions of each company. Efficiency and excellent benefits will be enhanced thanks to the combination of 2 smart technologies, including data analysis and cloud computing. This is one of the standard technologies that will be improved to bring the balance of quality, intelligence, and safety that suppliers bring to customers.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">To analyze and answer the question: “how cloud, service, and server technology has impacted industries during the globalization phase ?”, cloud computing will change in the direction of improving optimal data storage capacity and providing a peace of mind in data center security in the future. Cloud computing tends to transform storage-based operations and transport and secure data in the cloud instead of local server systems. In general, cloud computing has affected the economic and social development speed in many countries by directly impacting the finance of businesses in many different fields [7]. The aggressive race to bring existing offerings from corporate corporations to the public onto multi-cloud platforms has contributed to transforming the way technology intelligently operates.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The transformation of technology between local server systems to cloud computing has largely brought about a positive impact on small and medium enterprises. This development has opened up career opportunities related to the IT industry instead of cutting the staff of server facility management. Tech companies are constantly recruiting key positions to ensure the quality and performance of cloud platforms. Sometimes these systems will have technical and communication problems responsible for providing optimal solutions and fixing unexpected problems. Today, the problem of database security is very focused by companies, especially the risk of being attacked through cloud data is increasing. Employers often offer attractive perks to attract excellent candidates for these positions, which play a role in providing rights and handling legal issues about personal data use, carefully guarding security, and preventing third-party threats. In a nutshell, cloud computing has laid a necessary foundation and transferred from traditional to more modern technologies and created jobs for many employees with many different positions to match the speed of growth economic, social, technology.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">It can be seen that cloud storage applications, such as Google Drive, Onedrive, iCloud are no longer unfamiliar to the learning and working life of many people today. For me, these storage services give me the convenience of using computers. It helps to improve the problem of wasting computer hard drive space when storing all the essential documents, images, and movie files. Besides, with a regular moving schedule, cloud computing has helped me overcome the inconvenience. Instead of all data being copied via USB or portable hard drive from the desktop to be used on but now I can access my own cloud data anywhere, even around the world, with just one click of an internet connection. The cloud application allows mobile devices to automatically update from new updates from cloud service providers when there is a change in memory capacity and upload original files to the cloud. This is essential to prevent the loss of important data caused by the carelessness of the user. The above useful features have made me change how I store data and cloud applications that are indispensable in my phone and computer when studying and working every day because of flexible backing and recovering personal documents anywhere, anytime.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Cloud storage is expanding in educational and professional work environments. Educational institutions and schools are beginning to use technology in the teaching process including cloud computing and encourage students to use cloud platforms in submitting and storing assignments online. That is also why my friends and I communicate more with each other in sharing files of assignment or media through cloud applications. Developers of cloud storage applications have come up with usage packages that include personal and especially home cloud sharing, which is used by my family. This helps my family bring information connection among family members, making it easy and convenient to store meaningful memories. However, each person needs to have their own storage space to protect privacy is a basic human policy.</h6>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">Machine learning is an Artificial Intelligence application, a subset of AI. Currently, machine learning has three major types, namely supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Its application is variety such as speech recognition, facial recognition, autonomous cars, image recognition, etc. Each of them has a specific area and improved and developed over time to meet human demands. </h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">For supervised learning, it can predict whether a specific input is right or not. For example, it can either predict the image of the cat is true or false or evaluate the price of the stocks, houses based on various factors such as places, amount of money, etc. Regarding unsupervised learning, this method will heavily depend on the sequences of the inputs. For instance, when users listen to specific videos on Youtube, the recommendation of the next videos based on the category of the current ones. The last one is reinforcement learning, it can learn from experience and always want to maximize the solutions for the next time it is faced. These types of techniques can apply in various practical problems in daily lives such as self-driven cars, robots and even in games. Foremost, the state of the art of machine learning is deep learning.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In simple words, deep learning uses the composition of many nonlinear functions to model the complex dependency between input features and labels [8]. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where it is able to solve complex problems, learn from a large amount of data and be more specific with high accuracy than machine learning. With deep learning, it creates a new era of technology and applies advanced technology to help human solving problems and improve the living standard.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify"><i><u>Mind sports:</u></i></h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify w3-container">A match between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo is one of the most popular AI applications for victory in a game with humans. AlphaGo is a computer program developed by Google DeepMind in London while Lee Sedol is one of the world's best Go players. Although AlphaGo is not the first computer program to have victory over players, the system and algorithms of it are vital. The steps, variations and strategies for a go game have more than the number of atoms in the known universe, which is impossible for the system for calculating but AlphaGo can identify and learn it compared with other systems. AlphaGo can learn and train by playing with itself, another version of it, to improve the ability of victory.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify"><i><u>Speech recognition:</u></i></h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify w3-container">An application to speech recognition is a virtual assistant. Siri of Apple, Bixby of Samsung, Alexa of Amazon is one of the most popular of virtual communication with AI. Those applications can help users communicate with AI to find out the solutions, research for the problems in a short time or even enjoy the conversation with it. Another example is Elsa, which is an AI app for learning English with speaking, can process, evaluate and analyse the voice of learners and how to pronounce words like a native speaker.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify"><i><u>Facial recognition:</u></i></h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify w3-container">Facial recognition is usually used for security purposes as an advanced technology for protecting private information either for devices or places. Nowadays, facial recognition is becoming more commercial to advance users' experience. The Windows operating system is an example of login facial recognition where the computer needs to scan the user's face and store the data of the face for the first time and check whether it is right or not for the second time they log in. </h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Autonomous cars can be accessible to everyone roughly in the next seven years. The reason is that the self-driving car is harder than people expected. In 2020, you’ll be a “permanent backseat driver” the Guardian predicted in 2015 [9]. But then, they all failed from the expectation. The full version of autonomous cars may take 7 to 10 years to reach the actual self-driving car. The current version is just assisting the driver under the supervision of a driver in specific conditions, it is not fully autonomous without driver care and applies all its features in every country.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where it can solve many machine learning problems and build complex structures with high accuracy for the outcomes. Artificial neural network algorithms make both deep learning and machine learning applications more feasible, which solves problems by magnifying part of issues up to thousands of times. By simulating the human's brain, the computer now is likely to perform as a human being. </h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What is the likely impact ? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The impacts of machine learning and its subset, deep learning, is nearly in every aspect of our lives. It could be applied shopping, study, entertainment, etc. One of the potential impacts is shopping behaviour, where customers have a trend to purchase goods through online apps. AI systems recommend similar products and essential materials for users where they can pay less time searching for their likes. As a result, this method changes the way they buy their products and reduce the time for going shopping.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">However, those applications can never be enough, AI applications must have to do more. In healthcare, AI can help doctors diagnose disease for patients with high accuracy, support them with information about symptoms and advise them whenever they make mistakes. Also, robots take care for patients to help doctors follow the current status of the patients more quickly. This application will reduce unwanted issues when doctors and nurses are overloaded with the outbreak of diseases and increase a better service for patients. Currently, some researchers are working on a project by applying AI in remote surgery and using nanotechnology to cure cancer cases</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">If that application is highly successful, a milestone in healthcare will appear. Jobs for doctors will not be replaced by the advanced machine, in other words, it will reduce the complexity for people to follow this path. Since a doctor must learn and practice from university for even more than ten years before getting an official job, therefore, jobs for this role less than others because it requires a great effort, time, energy. With AI applications, it will support doctors to do their professionals better and make fewer mistakes before coming up with the final decisions.</h6><br>
        <h3><i>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Machine learning, an AI application, has a huge impact on my daily lives. As I prefer shopping online, it gives me a great experience of buying online products and enjoying entertainment by myself. Searching for one product can take a lot of time but with recommendations of AI of similar features and products, are very useful for searching for my likes.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">For my family, my parents can have a good service of AI application when they become older, they are able to be treated and cured with advanced technology. When my family suffers from the illness, robots or advanced services of AI help doctors to find a cure and increase the survival chance.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">When I am playing games with friends, machine learning applications in games can make the match become more interesting. In detail, playing statistical games in a group can help players increase their connections and training a team fight with other competitors, in this case, is AI.</h6><br>

        <h3 ><i>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">According to ICRA (International Conference on Robotics and Automation) Workshop video published in January 2020 [10], robots now have been developed to have legs so that they can walk on their own and have automatic API to help them work on a specific task automatically. Those robots were created to have the ability to scan and evaluate the environment that they are placed in using a camera or having a 2D distance sensor and built with different functions such as helping humans in construction sites (carrying objects, drilling nails, etc.) or even helping patients in rehabilitation centres learn to walk again, this robot type is called the Wandercraft. Besides that, Boston Dynamics had created a robot which they called the Atlas, the world's most humanoid robot [11]. Atlas also has the ability to demonstrate human-level agility as it has a total of 28 hydraulic joints and it’s movement speed can reach upto 1.5 m/s.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What can be done now? </i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">At this point of time, where humans use robots for different functions and different purposes in different industries that we have right now. For example, MIT had invented a robot called “Mini cheetah” to demonstrate the movement of the cheetah autonomously with the max speed of up upto 2.5 m/s [12]. In the hospitality industry, Japan had been using robots to run a hotel. This hotel - Henn na Hotel, has almost everything run automatically [13]. In Singapore, researchers had found a way to create robots that can put together IKEA furniture [14]. The way the robot works is similar to human’s. First it will need to have visuals on the parts and then calculate the steps needed to assemble the finished product. In medical field, where robots are used to increase efficiency at work with these types, hospital robots - which are used to distribute medications, lab specimens and sensitive materials around the hospital, surgical robots - used in open operation with mechanical arms with a camera and/or surgical equipment attached to them, which are controlled by a surgeon [15].</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In the future, robots may be used to replace humans more for these types of jobs such as delivering/shipping items from one place to another. For this to happen in the future, researchers need to combine current technologies like GPS to help the robot navigate the suitable routes, self driving or flexible mobility to support the machine on its journey, and environmental awareness so it can make the right decisions to the robot, so it can work autonomously on its own. Besides that, robots can be used in the police force to combat in order to reduce casualties to human officers in dangerous missions as robots are less vulnerable. This could be possible as now humanoid robots are now being produced and put to test their abilities and in the future, those robots will may have enough requirements to be put on to the work. Robots can be decided to be built by materials that are strong enough to withstand the damaging effects of most common lethal weapons but still doesn’t affect their mobility</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The increase of use of robots has brought a lot of impacts on different areas of life. Firstly, we have the factory manufacturing industry area. Robots help increase productivity growth, as in the manial working area required the workforce’s productivity to be constant with less workers needed as possible, this is when robots take part in. On the negative side, the invention of robots can have a lot of impacts on the life of humans as time goes on because new technologies come with new advanced, innovative robots. This means that a lot of workers can lose their jobs as the comparison between robots and humans efficiency in working in factories show that with the same amount of products produced required more human efforts than using robots, so they are now having robots to do repetition jobs in factories. But on the other side, it helps create more and more high-paying jobs which require more skilled-workers with more knowledge to do higher-valued works such as quality-related tasks which are more suitable to humans with skills . This means that people need to have higher education levels to be employed to be part of the workforce, increasing a person’s knowledge. Secondly, the increase in the amount of robots is directly proportional to the increase productivity depending on the purpose of the robots, which is also directly proportional to the increase in gross domestic product (GDP) of a country [16]. </h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">For my daily life, robots could bring me a lot of benefits when I bring them into use. For example, in my house, my mom has a cleaning robot to help her do the chores, the robot will go around the house to vacuum the floor. The robot has a built in memory where it records the house’s layout so it can create a cleaning route every time put into use. The benefit this robot brings is that I can spend less time doing the cleaning and I don’t need to put in a lot of effort as most of the cleaning has been done, I only need to clean those spots that were missed out by the robot and only need to empty the dust bag of the robot after two or three days. For my family, this robot is really handy as we have three cats in total, the problem of cats is that their fur can fall everywhere around the floor so we just need to use the machine to vacuum all the fur as it is similar to dust. Besides that, when the machine was put to use the cats enjoy playing with the machine. In conclusion, the robot that my family has is beneficial to not only humans but to pets too.</h6><br>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Autonomous car leaders have presented Level 4- the vehicle can independently perform all driving duties and control the driving circumstances – mostly, do all the driving – in certain conditions. The human does not need to be concentrated [18]. But the only program in some standard road conditions, good weather. Besides, customers can now experience autonomous driving at level 3, such as the Audi A8. The automatic steering system structure is made up of software and sensors which can identify obstacles, signs, and people in transportation. Machine learning, lidar projectors, radar, and ultrasonic sensors all work together to create a living map of the world that a self-driving car can navigate.[19]</h6><br>

        <h3 ><i>What can be done now? </i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">It is presently attainable to implement technologies of autonomous driving models in medical, transportation, institutional, or computing surroundings. </h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Tech organizations have processed a lot of experimentation to broaden the area of automated driving equipment. Hence, Google and Apple have poured capital into motor vehicle companies to alter communities' moving habits. Besides, Tesla also invested massively in autonomous vehicles to conquer tension when in traffic. [20]</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">By applying design features to diversify, standard self-driving systems formulate and sustain a unique outline of their surroundings based on a comprehensive arrangement of sensors, such as radars. At various stages, Google's criteria have utilized radar, lasers, high-powered cameras, and sonar. Uber's self-driving prototypes apply sixty-four laser beams and other sensors, to construct their internal map.[21] </h6><br>

        <br>
        <h3 ><i>What technological or other developments make this possible?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">To make the innovation come to actual Machine Learning Methods plays a vital role. Several prototypes of machine learning algorithms are being applied for various utilization in autonomous transports. This system concludes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are the standard, in-depth learning methodologies connected to autonomous driving.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">CNN is primarily utilized to concoct images and spatial data to extract innovations to identify the environment's intentions.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">RNNs are essential devices for working with mundane data, like videos.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">DRL mixes Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. This system allows software-defined 'agents' to determine the potential activities to accomplish their purposes, applying a premium capacity.[24]</h6><br>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">For demonstrating the influence of AI in general and Autonomous vehicles in specific to life,  It would be how AV combat with the 19 coronaviruses. Because of the pandemic's emergency, almost all cities in China lockdown, and people have to minimize face-to-face associations. Hence, AI, big data, and robot services are applied to restrict the virus.  To satisfy the demanded victuals, medicals, China requires maintenance from autonomous vehicles.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Therefore, Chinese carmakers have to push their products to supply automatic equipment adequately. And of course, people in the pandemic's area are remarkably affected by the benefit of AV. </h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Many autopilot devices are equipped with cameras and notifications sections, to substitute guards, to remind people to wear masks, and keep distance in public. According to the MIT Technology Review, one of the administrators in autonomous vehicle technology, Baidu, has published 104 driverless means of transport in 17 cities. These transportations perform priority anti-epidemic tasks like washing, sanitizing, logistics, and delivering. [25]</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Another vital influence is reducing personal time spending on driving, safety, and decreasing traffic congestion:</h6>
        <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:800px">
            <ul>
                <li><h6>Unsimilar to the original car, drivers have to spend all their time focusing on driving. Traveling with AV, drivers easily engage in other activities, such as communicating, reading news. Hence, they utilize their free time productively.</h6></li>
                <li><h6>More than 40% of fatal 38 crashes involve drink, disturbance, pill involvement, and tiredness (NHTSA 2012) [26]. With this problem, AVs potentially degrade crashes dramatically and keep traffic participation safer.</h6></li>

                <h6>As the current epidemic situation, AVs, as mentioned above, will be an essential 'weapon' to support people fight against viruses. It will serve as a mechanism of substituting people with moving, buying food, and making medical reports.</h6>
                <h6>Driving for everyone will become safer and more relaxed. Accidents will additionally occur less frequently, thereby decreasing traffic congestion.</h6>
                <h6>The family members will have more time to communicate, join each other instead of entirely focusing on driving.</h6>
                <li><h6><u>Negative:</u></h6></li>
                <h6>Because of the convenience of driving with an automated vehicle, people will become distracted from their safety as well as others.</h6>
                <h6>The situation of drunken traffic in transportation will rise because of some AVs' placement, the amount of alcohol and drugs will be consumed more, and that is harmful to human health.</h6>
                <h6>While the autopilot will help degrade traffic jams, it will also progress the fuel consumed by cars because cars will travel faster, thereby harmful to the green environment.</h6>

                <h6>Currently, I have realized that the improvement of AVs would still bring people more benefits than harm. It plays an essential role in humanity into a new era where there are not only autonomous moving devices but machines that can assist people in other aspects of activities such as medicine, education, mechanical. From my point of view, at present, AVs are still not suitable for Vietnam because of the topography of Vietnam and the situation in traffic participation as well as the habits of using Vietnamese means of transportation.</h6>
